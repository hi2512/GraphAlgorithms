Use make to create hw2 program.
hw2 takes in one argument, the input dimacs file.
The outputs are the dimacs file (additional edges
between the same nodes are removed with only the
largest weight remaining following the homework
spec), the node number and label file, and a file
containing the histogram. The pagerank is output
to standard output.
